# Features

Basic string translation has been added and can be invoked in the Auditor via detection of the language in `<html lang="{string}">` by default, or being specifically provided a language code in the Auditor options (see README.markdown).

# Fixes

* #160 - Allow unmatched elements for 4.1.2 which are role='button' to use aria labels to pass as valid names for an accessibility API. This will trigger on any element using that role.
* #210 - Added 'range' to the list of input types that are tested for labels.
* #209 - Changed wrapping input label to detect any parent <label> rather than just a direct parent.
* #191 - Now test for aria-hidden on element with role=presentation assigned and all parent nodes before checking any child elements that have semantic meaning.
* #204 - Tests for table headers now restricted to elements that belong to the table being tested rather than including possible child tables.
* #201 - No longer store and report on duplicate ids if the id is empty.
- #208 - No longer throws an obscure error when required by a node module.
