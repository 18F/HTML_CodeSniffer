### WCAG 2.0 Standards Updates
{: #standards-wcag2}

_References to Principles, Guidelines, Success Criteria and Conformance Requirements should be read in line with the [WCAG 2.0 Recommendation][WCAG20]._

#### Updates and bug fixes
{: #standards-wcag2-bugs}

* *Success Criteria 1.3.1, 4.1.2:*  

  The previous version ([2.0.2](./2.0.2)) updated handling of **label**s to form controls, however some other tests were not changed to remove requirements that **label**s be associated via the "for" attribute. Those seeing "H44" and "H91" errors on wrapped **label**s for this reason should no longer see them.
