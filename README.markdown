# HTML_CodeSniffer README

HTML_CodeSniffer is a client-side JavaScript that checks a HTML document or source code, and detects violations of a defined coding standard.

It can be used in two ways. Called directly in JavaScript source, HTML_CodeSniffer will provide a list of known and potential violations to the calling script. It also comes with a pop-up auditor interface, accessible via a bookmarklet, letting you browse through messages emitted from one of the defined standards. Where possible, the auditor also points you to the HTML element causing the problem.

## Which standards and sniffs does HTML_CodeSniffer include?

HTML_CodeSniffer comes with standards and sniffs that cover the three conformance levels of the W3C [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20).
