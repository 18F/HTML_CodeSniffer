## Definition

**Changes in context** include changes of: user agent; viewport; focus; [or] content that changes the meaning of the Web page.

The full ["understanding" page for Success Criterion 3.2.2](http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/consistent-behavior-unpredictable-change.html) is available from the W3C.
