# Success Criterion 2.4.9: Link Purpose (Link Only)

- **Applies to**: <abbr title="Triple A">AAA</abbr> only.

## Definition

Information about the user's location within a set of Web pages is available.

The full ["understanding" page for Success Criterion 2.4.8](http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/navigation-mechanisms-location.html) is available from the W3C.

This only tests the usage of link elements, however the following techniques are also sufficient where appropriate:
- Providing a breadcrumb trail.
- Providing a site map.
- Indicating current location within navigation bars.

With the latter, just changing the background colour is not sufficient (see Success Criterion 1.4.1, Use of Colour): something else should change, such as disabling the link, or adding an indicator such as an asterisk or bullet.

#### Testing

#### Examples

1.  Successful usage.

    Example:
    
        <html>
            <head>
                <link rel="start" href="start.html" />
            </head>
            <body>
            </body>
        </html>
        
#### Errors

1.  Successful usage.

    Example:
    
        <html>
            <head>                
            </head>
            <body>
                <link rel="start" href="start.html" />
            </body>
        </html>

1.  Fails because: no rel attribute is specified.

    Example:
    
        <html>
            <head>
                <link href="start.html" />
            </head>
            <body>
            </body>
        </html>

1.  Fails because: a rel attribute is specified but it is empty.

    Example:
    
        <html>
            <head>
                <link rel="" href="start.html" />
            </head>
            <body>
            </body>
        </html>

1.  Fails because: no rel attribute is specified. Reverse links (using the rev
attribute) have seen little usage and have been obsoleted in HTML5.  

    Example:
    
        <html>
            <head>
                <link rev="made" href="author.html" />
            </head>
            <body>
            </body>
        </html>

1.  Fails because: no href attribute is specified.

    Example:
    
        <html>
            <head>            
                <link rel="contents" />
            </head>
            <body>
            </body>
        </html>
        
1.  Fails because: a href attribute is specified but it is empty.

    Example:
    
        <html>
            <head>            
                <link rel="contents" href="" />
            </head>
            <body>
            </body>
        </html>
