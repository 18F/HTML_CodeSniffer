# Success Criterion 2.4.3: Focus Order

- **Applies to**: <abbr title="Single A">A</abbr>, <abbr title="Double A">AA</abbr>, <abbr title="Triple A">AAA</abbr>.

## Definition

If a Web page can be navigated sequentially and the navigation sequences affect meaning or operation, focusable components receive focus in an order that preserves meaning and operability.

The full ["understanding" page for Success Criterion 2.4.3](http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/navigation-mechanisms-focus-order.html) is available from the W3C.

## Techniques tested

[Detailed information about technique H4](http://www.w3.org/TR/2010/NOTE-WCAG20-TECHS-20101014/H4) is available from the W3C.

This technique speaks of using the tabindex attribute on elements to set a tab order when the default tab order is inadequate. Usually, it is not required and can cause problems in maintenance:

> Often, [G59: Placing the interactive elements in an order that follows sequences and relationships within the content](http://www.w3.org/TR/2010/NOTE-WCAG20-TECHS-20101014/G59) is sufficient and this technique is not necessary. It can be very easy to introduce usability bugs when setting the tab order explicitly.

A notice about this technique will be thrown when an element is found using the tabindex attribute.

#### Testing

> 1. Check if tabindex is used.
> 2. If tabindex is used, check that the tab order specified by the tabindex attributes follows relationships in the content.
