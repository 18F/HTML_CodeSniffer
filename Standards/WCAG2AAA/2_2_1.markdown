# Success Criterion 2.2.1: Timing Adjustable

- **Applies to**: <abbr title="Single A">A</abbr>, <abbr title="Double A">AA</abbr>.
- In <abbr title="Triple A">AAA</abbr>, this is superceded by [2.2.3: No Timing](./2_2_3).

## Definition

For each time limit that is set by the content, at least one of the following is true:

1.  **Turn off:** The user is allowed to turn off the time limit before encountering it; or
2.  **Adjust:** The user is allowed to adjust the time limit before encountering it over a wide range that is at least ten times the length of the default setting; or
3.  **Extend:** The user is warned before time expires and given at least 20 seconds to extend the time limit with a simple action (for example, "press the space bar"), and the user is allowed to extend the time limit at least ten times; or
4.  **Real-time Exception:** The time limit is a required part of a real-time event (for example, an auction), and no alternative to the time limit is possible; or
5.  **Essential Exception:** The time limit is essential and extending it would invalidate the activity; or
6.  **20 Hour Exception:** The time limit is longer than 20 hours.
