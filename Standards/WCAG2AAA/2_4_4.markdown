# Success Criterion 2.4.4: Link Purpose (In Context)

- **Applies to**: <abbr title="Single A">A</abbr>, <abbr title="Double A">AA</abbr>.
- A stricter definition applies at <abbr title="Triple A">AAA</abbr> level: [2.4.9 Link Purpose (Link Only)](./2_4_9).

## Definition

The purpose of each link can be determined from the link text alone or from the link
text together with its programmatically determined link context, except where the
purpose of the link would be ambiguous to users in general.

Note: "ambiguous to users in general" is defined as:

> the purpose cannot be determined from the link and all information of the Web page
> presented to the user simultaneously with the link (i.e., readers without
> disabilities would not know what a link would do until they activated it).
>
> Example: The word guava in the following sentence "One of the notable exports is
> guava" is a link. The link could lead to a definition of guava, a chart listing the
> quantity of guava exported or a photograph of people harvesting guava. Until the
> link is activated, all readers are unsure and the person with a disability is not
> at any disadvantage.

In other words, if a well-functioning user would be just as confused by the link as a disadvantaged user, this criterion would not be violated, since the purpose of accessibility rules such as this is that users with disabilities are not at any disadvantage to normal users. That is not to say, however, that applying the techniques would not be a good idea - for all users, not just those with disabilities.

### <a id="tech-incontext">Identifying the purpose of a link using link text combined with its programmatically determined link context</a>

This notice covers the many definitions of "link purpose in context":

- [G53: Identifying the purpose of a link using link text combined with the text of the enclosing sentence](http://www.w3.org/TR/2010/NOTE-WCAG20-TECHS-20101014/G53)
- [H77: Identifying the purpose of a link using link text combined with its enclosing list item](http://www.w3.org/TR/2010/NOTE-WCAG20-TECHS-20101014/H77)
- [H78: Identifying the purpose of a link using link text combined with its enclosing paragraph](http://www.w3.org/TR/2010/NOTE-WCAG20-TECHS-20101014/H78)
- [H79: Identifying the purpose of a link using link text combined with its enclosing table cell and associated table headings](http://www.w3.org/TR/2010/NOTE-WCAG20-TECHS-20101014/H79)
- [H80: Identifying the purpose of a link using link text combined with the preceding heading element](http://www.w3.org/TR/2010/NOTE-WCAG20-TECHS-20101014/H80)
- [H81: Identifying the purpose of a link in a nested list using link text combined with the parent list item under which the list is nested](http://www.w3.org/TR/2010/NOTE-WCAG20-TECHS-20101014/H81)
- [H33: Supplementing link text with the title attribute](http://www.w3.org/TR/2010/NOTE-WCAG20-TECHS-20101014/H33)

Only one notice will be emitted for each link, because only one . If there is a title attribute, a combined "H77-81/H33" notice will be emitted to draw attention to the title attribute, otherwise just a "H77-81" notice.

It is recommended that additional identifying information be placed before the link to avoid confusion for screen reader users.

### <a id="tech-h30">H30: Providing link text that describes the purpose of a link for anchor elements</a>

A notice for this technique is emitted at <abbr title="Triple A">AAA</abbr> level, where [Success Criterion 2.4.9](./2_4_9#tech-h30) applies, but not explicitly at lower levels because the "in context" rules in this Success Criterion is a superset of this. However, ensuring the link text is descriptive is ensuring is the best way of providing accessible links.
